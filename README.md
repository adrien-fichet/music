This is a web app to help me keep track of music I've listened to, as well as music that I haven't discovered yet!

It uses Svelte, Vite, Vitest and Typescript.

- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Run tests: `npx vitest run`
- Build: `python3 build.py`
- Check npm packages updates: `npx npm-check-updates`
